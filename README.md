# Synth Present Dump tools

Many synthesizers supports storing presets, and allow you to back them up to a computer.

While that's great for backup and restore purposes, most synthesizers don't have a way to display this information in a human readable format, like a simple one-page sheet listing all the settings.

These tools do exactly that.
